<H3>Ancient Ruins and Museums</h3>
<p><b>Lebanon</b> is full of interesting things to do. As one of the oldest cities in the world, 
Beirut is rich with history and culture. In the day time, consider strolling through Roman
 Hippodrome Ruins off of France Street in Downtown Beirut. A short walk away are the Roman Baths off of Capuchin 
Street that were discovered in 1968. Beirut also provides a few museums to explore, 
such as the National Museum of Beirut, 
the <i>Sursock</i> Museum, and the American University of Beirut museum. Click <A href= "https://www.the961.com/things-to-do-in-lebanon/museums-beirut">here</a> to view a list

<H3>The Coastline</h3>
<p>The Mediterranean Sea provides an escape from the bustling city life, giving us a cool
 breeze and crystal blue waters. Although the public beaches are usually very overcrowded,
 many private resorts are offered that provide much cleaner beaches and better amenities.</p>
